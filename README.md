# A Supervised Learning Approach to Predicting Loan Applicant's Expenditures in Loan Origination
This repository contains the code related to my M.Sc. Data Science thesis at the University of Helsinki. The work models and analyzes Statistics Finland's household consumption expenditure dataset from 2016, and makes predictions for the expensitures of a given household based on the modeling. A link to the thesis will be added here later.

Featuring methods and algorithms such as:
1) XGBoost (and its random forest-like variant, XGBoostRF)
2) CatBoost
3) Random Forest
4) Gaussian Processes
5) Elastic-net
6) SVR
7) Optuna
8) MLflow
